# Microtonal Brain Dump
---

*Things happen and sometimes things don't, but oftentimes, most things happen, unless of course they don't. This place is where I document everything in between and beyond thatâ€” or whatever I feel like really.*

*I'd like to think that my thoughts, when put into harmony, are that of a ii-V-I: simple, concise, and resolute. I would like to inform you, however, that my thoughts are more adjacent to Coltrane Changes, a knot of erratic chord changes, but if Coltrane enjoyed making atonal and dissonant music. Did I also mention making inconsistent and questionable voice leading decisions?*

*Scrolling down this page, expect to throw away any customs of neatness, form, or legibility, because frankly, my mind isn't a place where any of those exist, unfortunately. Have fun and get a deep dive of my thoughts.*

> "One last thing: I have just been told that our budget (I didn't know we even had one) has been cut down by 16%, so we're all going to have to settle for less, maybe." - J
