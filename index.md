# Microtonal Brain Dump

---

*Things happen and sometimes things don't, but oftentimes, most things happen, unless of course they don't. This place is where I document everything in between and beyond thatâ€” or whatever I feel like really.*

*I'd like to think that my thoughts, when put into harmony, are that of a ii-V-I: simple, concise, and resolute. I would like to inform you, however, that my thoughts are more adjacent to Coltrane Changes, a knot of erratic chord changes, but if Coltrane enjoyed making atonal and dissonant music. Did I also mention making inconsistent and questionable voice leading decisions?*

*Scrolling down this page, expect to throw away any customs of neatness, form, or legibility, because frankly, my mind isn't a place where any of those exist, unfortunately. Have fun and get a deep dive of my thoughts.*

> *"One last thing: I have just been told that our budget (I didn't know we even had one) has been cut down by 16%, so we're all going to have to settle for less, maybe. We alsp will have to settle for lots of sarcasm, yay." - J*


# Music That I Probably Enjoy

---

> *These are some personal favorites from the general repertoire that I listen to.*



### Blankets by Run Dorothy

*5/4 will always be the better waltz to me. <33*

### The Difference Between Medicine And Poison Is In The Dose by Circa Survive

*I love how the drums in the chorus are playing a 4/4 beat over a 3/4 time signature, so each measure alternates by starting either on the downbeat or upbeat.*

### Blossom by Porter Robinson

*I think it's always nice to take a break and listen to more down to earth and somber pieces like this.*

### Stitchface by Goodgame

*Who knew that a song about Peach from Smash Brothers Melee could be so emotional?*

# Circle of Fifths

---

*Let's give a moment to talk about the namesake of this website URL (and partly what Coltrane Changes are).*

![Thirds Changes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Thirds_cycle.png)

*Here is a chart of notes, starting with C, and consecutively going up a perfect fifth (+7 semitones). It's a handy tool in music, because you can get a lot of information out of it. If you go backwards (or counter-clockwise), you can find the Fourth intervals instead. Interestingly, you can see the progression of key signatures listed respectively by number of sharps or flats in the key. The keys when we use the notes in the right hand side of the circle as root notes are mostly sharp keys, while the left hand side notes make flat keys.* 

*This specific kind of Circle of Fifths is quite special because of the triangle in the middle. This triangle represents how the key centers move during Coltrane Changes, specifically in the tune Giant Steps. In the song, we always start with the ii-V-I of a single key, the most common resolution in jazz, and then we go throughout the keys following the triangle to create dynamic tonality. Coltrane was a little goofy like that.*
